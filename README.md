# flickrblender
WordPress Plugin to produce a slideshow of random flickr photos

Version 0.1

## Usage ##

You need to get a flickr API key.

Activate the plugin

in the Dashboard -> Settings FlickrBlender

fill in your API key and save

FlickrBlendrs are custom post types much like a page (as opposed to a post).

Create a new FlickrBlendr and publish.

At the moment there are no other steps. You can add text to the FlickrBlendr which will appear below the slideshow.

There is also no error checking if you do not fill in an API key. If you do not have a key you will just see a loading gif on the flickrblendr.
